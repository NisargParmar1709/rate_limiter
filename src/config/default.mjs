Half-Hackathon 2025: A Journey of Learning & Growth ðŸš€



ðŸ’¡ 8 hours of coding, brainstorming, and pushing our limitsâ€”Team Infinity took on the challenge of building an API Rate Limiting System, competing against degree students and higher-education participants!

Although we werenâ€™t the winners, we built something powerful and competed at an impressive level! ðŸ”¥



ðŸŽ¯ What We Built: SpeedGuard (API Rate Limiting Library)

ðŸ”¹ A robust rate-limiting middleware for Node.js & Express.js

ðŸ”¹ Supports multiple algorithms: Fixed Window, Sliding Window, Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket

ðŸ”¹ Redis-powered for high performance & scalability

ðŸ”¹ Exponential backoff to prevent abusive retries

ðŸ”¹ Fully customizable & easy to integrate



ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings

âœ… Solving real-world security challenges

âœ… Optimizing API performance under load

âœ… Collaborating effectively under tight deadlines



ðŸ’¬ Open to feedback and collaboration!

A huge thanks to Rajkot Information Technology Association and B H Gardi College of Engineering & Technology for hosting such an amazing event and to my incredible teammates Krish Bhensdadia, Krrish Chandegara, Milan Gohil and Niranjan Maru  for their dedication! ðŸ’™


ðŸ“¢ Call to Action:

If youâ€™re building scalable APIs and need a robust rate-limiting solution. Weâ€™re open to feedback, collaboration, and new ideas. Letâ€™s connect and build something amazing together!
